# Users Guide

Everything you need to know to use Headvroom effectively.

## What is Headvroom?

Headvroom is a visual knowledge management tool. Instead of folders and files, you organize information as a **graph** of connected **nodes**.

## Core Concepts

### Nodes
Individual items in your graph - ideas, topics, resources, projects, or anything else you want to track.

### Edges
Connections between nodes. They show relationships and let you navigate by clicking.

### InfoPanel
The sidebar that opens when you click a node. Contains notes, links, files, and more.

## Quick Reference
